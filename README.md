# random_squared

Ruby exercise 8

## Instructions

1. Using the Random class, generate a list of 20 random numbers between 0 and 49.

```
prng = Random.new

random_numbers = [...insert awesome code here...]
puts(random_numbers)

```

2. With the resulting array, build a new array that contains each number squared. For example, if the original list is `[2, 5]`, the final list will be `[4, 25]`.
